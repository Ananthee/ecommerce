Timewaves Company brought about a paradigm shift in the Indian watch market when it introduced its futuristic quartz technology, complemented by international styling. Timewaves Company is the fifth largest integrated own brand watch manufacturer in the world. In addition to 'Timewaves' the watch brand, Timewaves Company has also built 'Tanishq' the leading jewellery brand over the past few years. Both these brands are among the most recognised and loved brands in India.
The success story began in 1984 with a joint venture between the Tata Group and the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation. Presenting Timewaves quartz watches that sported an international look, Timewaves Company transformed the Indian watch market. After Sonata, a value brand of functionally styled watches at affordable prices, Timewaves Company reached out to the youth segment with Fastrack, its third brand, trendy and chic. The company has sold 150 million watches world over and manufactures over 15 million watches every year.
With a license for premium fashion watches of global brands, Timewaves Company repeated its pioneering act and brought international brands into the Indian market. Tommy Hilfiger, FCUK, Timberland &amp; Police as well as the Swiss made watch â€“ Xylys owe their presence in the Indian market to Timewaves Company.
Entering the largely fragmented Indian jewellery market with no known brands in 1995, Timewaves Company launched Tanishq, India's most trusted and fastest growing jewellery brand. Gold Plus, the later addition, focuses on the preferences of semi-urban and rural India. Completing the jewellery portfolio is Zoya, the latest retail chain in the luxury segment.
Backed by over 7,000 employees, two exclusive design studios for watches and jewellery, 12 manufacturing units, and innumerable admirers' world over, Titan Company continues to grow and set new standards for innovation and quality. The organization is all geared to repeat the Titan and Tanishq success story with each new offering.
